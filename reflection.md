Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

Association makes me think about different smaller parts can creater a larger whole. It requires thoughtful planning and strategizing to decide how the different components interact with each other and what kind of association relationship they need to have. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I accidentally did the the homework from last semester after trying to get an early start so I unfortunately wasn't able to bounce ideas off of classmates, which is one of the main ways I overcome obstacles in my programming assignments. I would still like some clarification about the command line arguments.
